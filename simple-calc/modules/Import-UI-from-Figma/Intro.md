# Importing UI from Figma

In this module, you will learn how to import the UI from Figma.  
Figma is a collaborative app UI design tool that allows users to create, share, and comment on designs in real time. It then allows exporting the UI in selected markup language for developers to carry on with the pre-designed app.

Uno Platform offers a Figma plugin that enables exporting the UI designed in Figma as both XAML and C# Markup.
In this module, you'll learn how to export the UI from a pre-existing Figma design for the SimpleCalculator app, how to import it into the app you've started to create in the previous modules.

## Open the Figma file and set up an account

1. Open the SimpleCalculator Figma file via [this link](https://aka.platform.uno/uno-figma-simplecalc-workshop).

1. If you are not signed in with Figma, you will be asked to do so. Create an account if you don't have one. Follow the instructions to sign up with your Google account or use a username and password.
