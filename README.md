# Workshops for the Uno Platform [![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-24-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)

The Uno Platform allows C# and XAML built applications to run on Web (WebAssembly), Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows.

Use the  tooling from Windows in [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/), such as [Hot Reload](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/features/working-with-xaml-hot-reload.html#:~:text=The%20Uno%20Platform%20Hot%20Reload,the%20inner%20developer%20loop%20faster), [XAML Edit and Continue](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/04/06/ui-development-made-easier-with-xaml-edit-continue/) and [C# Edit and Continue](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-use-edit-and-continue-csharp). Build your application as much as possible on Windows, then validate that your application runs on [all supported platforms](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/getting-started/requirements.html). 

## Workshops

- [SimpleCalc](simple-calc): The SimpleCalc workshop will guide you in setting up your developer environment to begin building your first app. You'll also gain insights into the tools, libraries, and patterns crucial for Uno Platform app development.

- [TubePlayer](tube-player): In the TubePlayer workshop, we will create a simple Uno Platform app for searching and playing YouTube videos. The app will have a search page for finding videos and a player page for watching them.
